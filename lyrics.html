            A painted heart on a sidewalk
A bleeding sun on a silver screen
I feel my ego when I talk
Lost myself in the in between
Lustful eyes filled with love now
Sending in every calvary
A few more souls on the bus now
Shut my eyes right at 17
Always hits me
I'm always shifting
Take my hand
Now and forever
Where I stand
How can you live and let die
Young man, look in the mirror
Take my hand and don't you ever let go
Take my hand now and forever
Take my hand now and forever
Don't you ever let go (take my hand now and forever)
Take my hand now and forever
Told myself maybe someday
I'd fall down from the centerpiece
I treat my mind like an ashtray
I owe you an apology
Breaking plans on a Sunday
With myself maybe make some peace
I forgot every birthday
Open eyes right at 23
Always hits me, yeah
I'm always shifting
Take my hand
Now and forever
Where I stand how can you live and let die
Young man look in the mirror
Take my hand and don't you ever let go
Take my hand now and forever
Take my hand now and forever
Don't you ever let go (take my hand now and forever)
Take my hand now and forever
Pick apart all of the pieces
Well, I'm running out of time
Iron out all of the creases and just hang it out to dry
Shallow hearts for shallow minds
That ache to be alive
You fall apart and redefine what keeps you up at night
Oh, take my hand
Now and forever
Where I stand just as you're losing yourself again
Look in the mirror
Take my hand
Now and forever
Where I stand
How can you live and let and die
Young man look in the mirror
Take my hand
And don't you ever let go
Take my hand now and forever
Take my hand now and forever
Don't you ever let go (take my hand, now and forever)
Take my hand now and forever
